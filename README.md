## üõ† How to use

Each tool includes:
- A `README.md` with usage instructions.
- CloudFormation templates (`template.yaml`) for easy deployment.
- The actual Lambda or script source code.

## üí° Why this repo?

AWS offers a huge number of services and APIs, but sometimes small missing features (like deleting a non-empty S3 bucket) can block automation or require extra manual work.

This repo exists to bridge those gaps with minimal, reusable, open-source tools.
